  project_id = 123456
  region     = "eu_nord_1"
}

#Create a new server with options:
resource "cherryservers_server" "server" {
  plan             = "cloud_vps_1"
  hostname         = "sharing-wallaby"
  project_id       = 123456
  region           = "eu_nord_1"
  image            = "ubuntu_22_04"
  ssh_key_ids      = ["1", "2"]
  ip_addresses_ids = ["8269de5d-9b89-af9a-8bcc-8efb4d9fa282"]
  spot_instance    = true
